# Genetic adaptation of gut commensal bacteria under xenobiotic exposure

The gut microbiome plays a critical role in human health and is exposed to hundreds of thousands of different compounds that are foreign to the host, referred to as xenobiotics. These exposures affect the composition of the gut microbiota; however, their impact on the mutation and adaptation of the microbiome is unknown. In this study, we investigated the genetic variation of one of the most prevalent gut commensals, Bacteroides uniformis, under exposure to different xenobiotics, including medications, environmental contaminants, food additives, and natural food compounds, in vitro using adaptive laboratory evolution. We detected variations within the coding sequences of the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) efflux pump, a potential regulatory region upstream of SusC/D, and the potassium uptake system protein TrkAH coding genes, under different xenobiotic exposures. These mutations indicated a potential change in their ability to colonize the gut and interact with chemical compounds. Additionally, we examined the variation landscape of B. uniformis across different cohorts using publicly available datasets to uncover the selection processes shaping the intra-species diversity of gut bacteria in vivo. Our study deepens our understanding of the gut microbiome's adaptation to daily xenobiotic exposure and aims to inspire further implications for human health, such as personalized medicine.
